# Apple Stock Proce Forecasting Model
# Objective
Developed a predictive model to forecast Apple stock prices based on historical closing price data, with a focus on capturing time-dependent patterns.
# Tools Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and feature engineering
- TensorFlow/Keras: For developing and training the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
# Solution 
- Collected and cleaned historical stock price data, addressing missing values and normalizing features for model optimization.
- Designed an LSTM model architecture to effectively capture temporal dependencies in the stock price data.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for robust evaluation of the model's performance.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model and ensure accurate predictions, dealth with overfitting of the model.
# Conclusion
The LSTM model achieved a low RMSE of 0.02 on the validation dataset, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting stock price movements. The project provided valuable insights into time-series forecasting and highlighted the potential of machine learning models for financial market analysis and decision-making.
